You will need 3 TIP29C transistors — one for each color channel (Red, Green, Blue) of the RGB strip.

Each TIP29C controls current to one color line of the strip.

TIP29C Pinout (Looking at flat side, legs down):
DO NOT BOLT TRANSISTORS TO METAL INLESS METAL IS ISOLATED FROM EACH OTHER TIP29C IS NPN MEANING NEG/POWER/NEG
IF NOT ISOLATED THAN BOLT TO A NON CONDUCTED MATERIAL.

      |       |
      | TIP29C|

      | B C E |
        1 2 3

B = Base
C = Collector
E = Emitter

Wiring for One Color Channel (e.g. Red on D2)
Arduino Pin	Connect To
D2	TIP29C Base through a 1KΩ resistor
TIP29C Collector	Red wire of LED strip
TIP29C Emitter	GND (Arduino GND and LED power GND must be shared)
LED Strip +5V	5V Power Supply (Not Arduino 5V pin if strip is high current)

Repeat same for:
D4 → Green channel
D7 → Blue channel

Power Notes
DO NOT power the LED strip directly from the Arduino 5V pin — use a separate 5V power source if your strip draws more than 500mA.

Connect the GND of the 5V power source to Arduino GND, or the LEDs won’t switch properly.

Full Example for Red Channel
Arduino D2 → 1KΩ resistor → TIP29C Base
TIP29C Collector → Red wire of RGB LED strip
TIP29C Emitter → GND

+5V power supply → +5V of LED strip

Powersupply GND → LED GND & Arduino GND

D2 (Red)	→ 1KΩ resistor → Base of TIP29C #1 → Collector to Red LED wire
D4 (Green)	→ 1KΩ resistor → Base of TIP29C #2 → Collector to Green LED wire
D7 (Blue)	→ 1KΩ resistor → Base of TIP29C #3 → Collector to Blue LED wire
Emitters	All go to GND
LED Strip +5V	Connects to 5V power supply (not Arduino!)
Power GND	Shared between LED strip, power supply, and Arduino GND.

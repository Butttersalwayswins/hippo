Microcontroller: Arduino Pro Mini (5V, 16MHz) programmed via CH340G USB-to-Serial adapter.
Communication: Serial communication over COM7; baudrate=9600
Servo's using d3,d5,d6,d9,d10,d11
Commands "s1go","s2go","s3go","s4go","s5go" and "s6" 
All servo power wires go to a separate 5V power rail (not Arduino 5V pin).
RGB LED Strip: 4-pin 5V RGB LED strip controlled through TIP29C NPN transistors connected to Arduino pins D2, D4, and D7.
4 IR sensors (A0â€“A3) wired but not installed yet
If signal stability is an issue, you can add a 10k pull-down resistor on the OUT line of each ir sensor (optional).
